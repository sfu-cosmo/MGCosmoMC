#
# BICEP2/Keck Array/Planck joint likelihood
# 
# The file contains the input parameters to CosmoMC to reproduce the
# likelihoods of the fiducial analysis in Section III B and Figure 6
# of A Joint Analysis of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck Data
# using CosmoMC release Jan 2015
#
# For details of the setup see BKPlanckonly.ini and BKPlanck.ini
# and comments therein.
#
# Note: Once the chains are created, use the BKPlanck_01_fiducial_dist.ini as input to
#       CosmoMC's getdist to produce smooth likelihoods.
#
# Note: .ini files for the "variations from the fiducial data set and model"
#       described in Secs. III C and Figs. 7, 8, and 9 of 
#       A Joint Analysis of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck Data
#       as well as matching .ini files for getdist are available in
#       CosmoMC's batch2/BKPlanck folder or on http://bicepkeck.org/
